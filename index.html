                    description: "This week has been all about transforming research insights into tangible design decisions and beginning to shape Cora's personality as a semi-interactive companion. \n\nAfter wrapping up my user research analysis (which I succesfully found participants for), I started working on creating low-fidelity wireframes on figma. The goal here was not to come up with polished frames but instead ensuring that each screen served an actual purpose instead of a buffer. Referring back to a research document I made earlier (MVP vs Future Enhancements), I was able to create the required frames for a MVP. I also mapped out user journeys for key features to understand how the user will interact with the app to achive its desired output. \n\nMy most joyful task of this week was to start defining Cora's conversational personality. I thought long and hard about what would define it was an empthatic companion that is non-judgemental. I focused on tone and simple things such as using contractions and emojis in a way that isn't excessive but instead mirroring a human like companion. \n\nKey Deliverabes: Low-fidelity wireframes in Figma, User journey maps, Cora Conversational Flow Documentation"

                    description: "Week 3 focused on planning my user testing phase and deepening my understanding of the application architecture, which has been helpful in mapping out how users and information will flow through the app. \n\nInitally when I started to think about potential users for my product testing, I wanted it to accurately reflect my target audience which meant I couldn't just recruit my friends for convenience. I am still in the process of recruiting users that accurately fit my target audience but I have reached out to my univeristy research groups and wellbeing centre to advertise this testing phase and hopefully someone will reach out! I've developed a set of thoughtful questions that will be distributed to participants via a Google survey for Phase 1 testing. \n\nAdditionally, I worked on the required PPRS handout this week, which proved to be a relatively straightforward task since I'd already conducted extensive research so it was largely a matter of organizing and presenting the information appropriately.\n\nThis entry marks the end of phase 1 already as next week marks the start of Phase 2 - Design & Early User Feedback.\n\nKey Deliverabes: Phase 1 Tesing survey created, Consent forms prepared, Application Architecture Research"

                    description: "During this week, I dedicated significant time to strengthening my foundational knowledge of Swift and iOS development principles. I conducted a comprehensive review of Swift fundamentals, reinforcing core concepts and exploring advanced features that will be essential for building a robust application. Additionally, I immersed myself in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines to ensure the application design adheres to best practices for iOS user experience and interface design.\n\nI also investigated SQLite integration within Swift, researching optimal implementation strategies for local data persistence. This research included examining various Swift database libraries and frameworks to determine the most efficient approach for managing user data within the application architecture.\n\nFurthermore, I began the initial design phase by creating a preliminary logo concept in Figma, establishing the visual identity foundation for the project. This logo is now present as the favicon of this website! I also drafted a detailed feature specification document that clearly distinguishes between minimum viable product (MVP) functionality and features designated for future development phases.\n\nKey Deliverables: Swift fundamentals review completed, iOS HIG study finished, SQLite implementation research documented, Logo design initiated in Figma, MVP scope defined"

Additionally, I developed this documentation website to systematically track project progress and milestones.\n\nI also carried out extensive research into Apple HealthKit documentation to gain a comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and integration requirements for third-party applications. The Apple Developer documentation was an invaluable resource, providing clear and well-structured guidance throughout this research phase.\n\nFurthermore, I completed a thorough competitor analysis, examining existing applications within the health and wellness space to identify market gaps and opportunities. This analysis helped reinforce the significant need for PulseCor, an empathetic, non-judgmental habit-building application that addresses a clear gap in the current market landscape.\n\nKey Deliverables: Project Proposal submission, Developement Environment setup, Competitor Analysis complete"
